# Bayesian estimation of cross-coupling and reflection systematics in 21cm array visibility data

Notebooks for the modelling and subtraction of signal chain systematics in simulated 21-cm visibilities using a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler. 

Fiducial data sets are from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionisation Array (HERA) validation simulations (Aguirre et al. 2022). Systematics are generated with hera_sim (https://github.com/HERA-Team/hera_sim).
